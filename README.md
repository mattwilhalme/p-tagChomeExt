# p-tagChromeExt
Chrome extension for adding <p> tags to content quickly for web production.

Opens in a popup window so you don't have to navigate away from your open content management system screen and with the click of a button adds <p> tags to eliminate problems created by copy/paste from other word processors and email.

Does not retain hyperlinks. Does not include closing tags.

This is my first Chrome extension.
